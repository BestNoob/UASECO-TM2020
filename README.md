Hello guys,
this is my Fork of UASECO 0.9.7 for TM2020 Trackmania https://trackmania.com/

I want to get it to run with TM2020 but ! ATTENTION! Actual changes keep Clients to crash from time to time (game is instantly closing)
This Fork/Branch is tested on Windows Server. To USE IT follow the installation instructions of UASECO https://www.uaseco.org/
You should setup fresh server controllers for TM2020, its not recommended to use existing installations from TM2.

Working Alternatives to UASECO are PyPlanet https://github.com/PyPlanet/PyPlanet and EvoSC https://github.com/EvoTM/EvoSC

This FORK is OPEN for Feedback.

UASECO is a fork of the XAseco2/1.03 controller for Trackmania and has been overhauled to support the Modescript Gamemodes of Trackmania² in Maniaplanet and changes to run with PHP/7.x or newer.
Only Modescript Gamemodes of Trackmania² are supported, there is no support included for the legacy Gamemodes of Trackmania².



What means UASECO?
==================

ASECO is an abbreviation of Automatic SErver COntrol, the prefix U at UASECO stays for undef, which follows the same naming convention initiated by Xymph for XAseco.

This project was forked in May 2014 from XAseco2/1.03 release and was mixed with parts/ideas from MPAseco and ASECO/2.2.0c, for supporting the Trackmania² Modescript Gamemodes from the Maniaplanet/3+ update.

Many parts has been rewritten in 2017 again because of the ModeScript API changes for the Maniaplanet/4 update.
