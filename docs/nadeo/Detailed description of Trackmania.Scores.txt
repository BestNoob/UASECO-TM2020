~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Nadeo game modes scripts are divided into several parts: Match > Maps > Rounds > Turns. A match is played on one or several maps,
a map is composed of one or several rounds and a round can be further divided into one or several turns. Depending on the modes the
granularity will be more or less used.

The scores are tied to this subdivision system. As each modes can have very different scoring systems, the points sent in the
callback can vary but the general philosophy is the following:

 - The "matchpoints" represent a player or team points cumulated over several maps. They are reset when the match ends. eg:
   in a BO5 teams match, the match points could be 3-2.
   In the cup mode the match points are the points cumulated by the players since the beginning of the match over several maps.

 - The "mappoints" represent the points a player cumulated since the beginning of the map. They are reset at the end of each map.
   eg: in Rounds mode, these are the points you cumulate until you reach the limit and win the map.

 - The "roundpoints" are the points won during the round. They are reset at the end of each round. eg: in Rounds mode,
   these are the points you score at the end of the race: 10,6,4,3,...
