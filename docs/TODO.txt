UASECO
~~~~~~
 - BUG: /jukebox display not working properly
 - BUG: Multilap handling: No local record after finishing a lap on multilap Maps in the second lap (because the LibXmlRpc_OnWayPoint didn't reset the time, the time grows up on each lap)
 - STYLE: At score, the score table overlaps the reminder of ManiaKarma plugin.
 - Build a ET function into uaseco.php that communicates the amount of players/specs, server infos (login, name... neighborhood like) and the maps of the server
 - Split plugin.manialinks.php into the related plugins and change all old fashioned Windows to the window.class.php, after that remove it
 - Split plugin.panels.php into the related plugins and remove it
 - Lift dependecies from plugin.styles.php and remove it


Records-Eyepiece
