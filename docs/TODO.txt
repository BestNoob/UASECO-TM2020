 - BUG: Multilap handling: No local record after finishing a lap on multilap Maps in the second lap (because the LibXmlRpc_OnWayPoint didn't reset the time, the time grows up on each lap)
 - STYLE: At score, the score table overlaps the reminder of ManiaKarma plugin.
 - When jukebox a map that's recently been played, it gives the message (recently played, please wait) but then jukes it anyway. I imagine it's because I'm a masteradmin so it overrides but it's odd to get both messages in any case.
 - Split plugin.manialinks.php into the related plugins and change all old fashioned Windows to the window.class.php, after that remove it
 - Split plugin.panels.php into the related plugins and remove it
 - Lift dependecies from plugin.styles.php and remove it
