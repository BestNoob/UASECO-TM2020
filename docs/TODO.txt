UASECO
~~~~~~
 - STYLE: At score, the score table overlaps the reminder of ManiaKarma plugin.
 - BUG: Class Window registers more then once the callback 'onPlayerManialinkPageAnswer', which results into a massive problem on the second call of e.g. "/help" and the next pages
 - BUG: Output into the Windows console with utf8 chars messed up
 - Build a ET function into uaseco.php that communicates the amount of players/specs, server infos (login, name... neighborhood like) and the maps of the server
 - Split plugin.manialinks.php into the related plugins and change all old fashioned Windows to the window.class.php, after that remove it
 - Split plugin.panels.php into the related plugins and remove it
 - Lift dependecies from plugin.styles.php and remove it
